# Overview

This is a weather app that fetches and display weather forcast based on user's current or desired location


I could have used more plain HTML and Javascript to accomplish my goal of this app. But i decided to use javaScript framework which is  [NodeJs](https://nextjs.org/) because I want to increase my use of modern tools and library to such as [ShadCn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/guides/queries) and react-form to build my projects. I wrote component as pure JavaScript functions to help me with ease in the process of building the components. 

## Learning Outcome

I was able to learn and implement alot with the tools. It was easier to fetch abd refetch data in the client component without needing useEfect. I use ShadCn library to implement accessible components without needing to write all html and CSS from scratch

# Future Work

- The returned openWeather api is not well structured for the free plan, so i plan on using a diffrent api in the future.
- The user Interface does not realy portrait nicely, so i plan on restructuring it in the future.
